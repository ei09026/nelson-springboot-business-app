= Business Automation -  Springboot Runtime App

image::images/aim.jpg[800,800] 


== The Aim 

* A re-usable Springboot Busines Application with _minimal_ dependencies to provide a Runtime for JBPM/Drools (RHPAM/RHDM) business projects

== The Requirements

1. *MUST:* be possible to load/expose a KJAR (KieContainer) by simply giving a GIT repository
2. *MUST:* Absolute minimum dependencies must be https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga[Red Hat public maven artifacts] and availability of http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp://mirror.reverse.net/pub/apache/[maven binary] 
3. *MUST:* 
4. *MUST:*
5. *MUST:*
6. *MUST:*

* 1. - *MUST:* I want to not be hindered by environmental dependencies what are these? (DB, NEXUS, ALL NEXUS Dependencies require in the image, Security for roles)
* 2. - *MUST:* I want to not be hindered by environmental dependencies running it (docker, kubernetes, openshift should be the same)
* 3. - *MUST:* to Have: I would like to have the option to externalize DB (with minimum -maven/springboot profile-)
* 4. - *MUST:* to Have: I would like to have Monitoring via RHPAM Monitor/Business Central possible)
* 5. - *MUST:* to Have: I would like to ???

== How To Use

IMPORTANT: Important: Before using note that by default this App provides the minimum configurations. See xref:anchor-2[How To Further Configure the App]

1. _Fork_ this repository for every new service (ie. this is just a baseline)
2. _Run_ *JenkinspipelineBatch.sh* script to create KJARs binaries, a repository of their dependencies (along with the KJARs installed in it), configurations for the Springboot Runtime App (service-name.xml kie-server-state, application-XXX.properties) based on what is to run)
* *[Parameter 1]* a list of KJARs to be loaded into Springboot App. The list must have the following format `containerAlias-1#RuntimeStrategy#GIT_REPO-1,containerAlias-2#RuntimeStrategy#GIT_REPO-2,containerAlias-N#RuntimeStrategy#GIT_REPO-N`
* *[Parameter 2]* Name of Business Service (will be used for config file, 'kieserver.serverId', 'kieserver.Name')

3. Run the Service as xref:anchor-1[How to run the Sprinboot Service] and then Use the API
* Get Containers List

	curl -u 'user:user' -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://127.0.0.1:8090/rest/server/containers'

* Start Process

	curl -u 'user:user' -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}' 'http://127.0.0.1:8090/rest/server/containers/[YOUR-ALIAS]/processes/[YOUR-PROCESS-ID]/instances'
	eg. curl -u 'user:user' -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{}' 'http://127.0.0.1:8090/rest/server/containers/retail/processes/my-process/instances'

=== How to run the Sprinboot Service

=== Run the service locally via Maven

	mvn spring-boot:run -Dkie.maven.settings.custom=settings-local-only.xml -Dorg.kie.server.startup.strategy=LocalContainersStartupStrategy


=== Run the service locally as Docker

	TBD

=== Run the service in K8s/Openshift cluster

	TBD

== How To Further Configure the App

1. Security (Adding Users/External Security)
2. Database
3. Timers
4. APIs
